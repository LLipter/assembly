# Compilation Steps
1. Preprocessing. This resolves compiler directives such as #include (file inclusion), #define (macro definition), and #if (conditional compilation) by invoking the program cpp. Compilation can be stopped at the end of the preprocessing phase with the -E option, which writes the resulting C source code to standard out.
2. Compilation itself. The source code that results from preprocessing is translated into assembly language. Compilation can be stopped at the end of the compilation phase with the -S option, which writes the assembly language source code to filename.s.
3. Assembly. The assembly language source code that results from compilation is translated into machine code by invoking the as program. Compilation can be stopped at the end of the assembly phase with the -c option, which writes the machine code to filename.o.
4. Linking. The machine code that results from assembly is linked with other machine code from standard C libraries and other machine code modules, and addresses are resolved. This is accomplished by invoking the ld program. The default is to write the executable file, a.out. A different executable file name can be specified with the -o option.
