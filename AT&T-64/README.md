# How to run these codes

All codes are written under linux operating system with `gcc` and `as` tools installed. I test these codes under `Ubuntu 16.04`. Each program is placed in a separate directory within which a `Makefile` is properly written. Thus, run `make` in directory you're interested in. Then run executable file compiled accordingly.
